   <h3>BunnyPad application reaches 100 downloads, beans spilled about development</h3>

   <p>In the past 2 weeks, the Python notepad named BunnyPad reached 100 downloads on the official download platform, itch.io. As the programmer, @GarryStraitYT on Twitter, noted: <blockquote>"To say this was unexpected would be an understatement yet false at the same time. Yes, we expected it to reach 100 downloads, but not at the rapid pace it did!"</blockquote></p>

  <p>The developer made a video about the notepad, but due to technological problems, the audio can barely be made out, but the developer did state later on in a Discord Group Chat, "People often assume I'm the person who made BunnyPad. They always say that BunnyPad is 'the notepad alternative made by Garry', but that is simply <strong>not true</strong>. PBbunnypower, also known as Bunny, is the true creator of BunnyPad. She made the icon and is who it is dedicated to, yes, but without her, BunnyPad wouldn't ever have been made, and there would have been no need for GSYT Productions. I was inspired by her artwork to make the program, and I asked her if she could make a bunny holding the notepad. She chose the colors and the design. The Bluescreen-of-Death-colored bunny, the reference to her OC, and the OCs of other members in her circle of friends, were all her, not me. Versions 1 through 3 used old code, and were deprecated. But Bunny designed the PrettyFonts engine. In fact, she <b>NAMED</b> it. It's when she said 'bunny want pretty fonts' that named the engine that makes BunnyPad what it is today. Version 7, codenamed LegendStatus, will be the ultimate version of BunnyPad, and will have a limited-edition ZeRoTeCh00 Variant"</p>

  
   <h3>BunnyPad Developer hints at new rap song in development.</h3>

   <p>In a surprising twist, @GarryStraitYT (Twitter) posted a tweet of an image that stated, "If this post gets community noted, I'll release a new diss track." Having it been 5 months since the release of Psychological Warfare, a now-privated diss track, the community, including RedPCat, someone who was targeted in Psychological Warfare, is hyped for the new diss track. As the rapper noted, "This time will be better, as I have a better microphone and more experience. I know what makes it good, and what could get me cancelled if taken out of context, but I am willing to take the risk."</p>
  
   <h1>YouTuber's guide to making videos</h1>
	<h4> Written by Garry Strait </h4>

   <p>Many people want to become YouTube Stars. Some are interested in cybersecurity, others in music, and few in polymorphic content. As a YouTuber myself, I specialize in a polymorphic, or constantly changing, content base. Some things I have found out is that unbiased tech review videos, such as my one video about an unknown Windows executable and another about the Avast Antivirus, are popular video topics in this era of YouTube, so that will be a great basis to start on. One thing I have found out through my personal experience, is that if you have lower-end equipment, that it makes sense to enunciate words, and to make them clear. While some people tell you to edit out mistakes, I personally prefer keeping raw content, unless I have to edit something or piece videos together.</p>
	<p><br><br>Another thing I have found out is that it's best to be neutral and to avoid controversial content, such as racial issues, political beliefs, and whatnot. Also, the best way, in my opinion, to deal with haters, it to ask them "anything else" until they admit defeat, then simply go on about your day like the event never even happened.<br><br>Overall, just do what you feel is right, but avoid certain things, as it can help your career and overall reputation</p>
